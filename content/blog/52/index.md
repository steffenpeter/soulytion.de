excerpt: 'At the end of the geocentric supercluster (10 important aspects) now we have 4 ingresses (Mars, Earth, Venus, Mercury) within few days. Right now the @ES (as well as the INX) is at Jupiter line (yellow in the chart). Whatever happens now will have some significance. My guess is shown by the arrows.'
