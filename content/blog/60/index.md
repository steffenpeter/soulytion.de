<p>Finally I finished the new version of the planetary indicator package. Ok, itâ€™s not really finished because there are still thousand things to add, to refine, to doÃ¢â‚¬Â¦</p>
<p>Anyway a new version can be found <a href="/archives/category/planetaryindicators/" title="here">here </a>and it comes with two major improvements</p>
<blockquote><p>First, the indicators are now ready for intraday usage. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s possible now to see the aspects precise on the minute. And itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s amazing to see how often markets turn exactly on specific constellations.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Second, forward projection is much easier now Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and that without loss of precision. So if you want to see all important aspects coming in the next week, just add the indicator and add some space to the right. It also works on any chart from intraday to monthly</p></blockquote>
<p>Also a lot of new options are hidden in the indicators. I think I mentioned most of them in the manual at least. The manual is inside the installation package, but it can be downloaded separately.</p>
<p>For <a href="download" title="/archives/category/planetaryindicators/">download </a>ofÃ‚ the indicator package or the manual, just follow the <a href="/archives/category/planetaryindicators/" title="--&gt; LINK &lt;--">â€“&gt; LINK &lt;â€“</a></p>
<p align="center"><a href='{% image "pi_idex.png", "linkonly" %}' title="Intraday Planetary Lines and Aspect Filter for S&amp;P Future">{% image "pi_idex.png", "." %}</a></p>
<p>The chart shows an example intraday planetary lines and aspectsÃ‚ on the S&amp;P Future for the last week of November.Ã‚ Apparently the planets do not care about holidays ðŸ™‚</p>
