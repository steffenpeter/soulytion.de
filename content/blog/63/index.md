<p>Happy New Year 2010!</p>
<p>Looking at the Bradley graph this yearÃ‚ can be quite interesting:</p>
<p align="center"><a href='{% image "bradley_geo_2010.png", "linkonly" %}' title="Bradley Siderograph 2010 (geo)">{% image "bradley_geo_2010.png", "." %}</a></p>
<p>Sure, the one year view is not so impressive. But have a look at the long term. The low of geocentric Bradley in 2010 is the lowest low since 1900.<br/>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center">{% image "bradley_geo_long.png", "." %}</p>
<p><br/>
Such extreme points in the Bradley do not necessarily mean there will be a sort of crash. They donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even mean that there will be any sort of low. Rather they usually indicate the end of one (long term) cycle in the markets and the start of a new one.</p>
<p>Now is the question: will it conclude the consolidation in stock markets weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve seen in the last ten years? Or will it finally finish the bull market that started 30/40 years ago? Guess what, I donâ€™t know ðŸ™‚</p>
