<p>The Jupiter ingress coming this weekend is the third since January 2009 . The last two coincided exactly (!) with important medium term highs (see yellow lines in chart below). So it appears to be justified to assume a high within the next few days!?</p>

<p>The chart definitely suggests so, but extending the history reveals some interesting additional information. Since 1970 only two Jupiter ingresses coincided that exactly with medium term highs – the two we can see in the chart. All other 51 ingresses did not.</p>
<p>Extending the orb to 10 days (before and after the ingress) at least we get 11 highs (and 4 lows). Following a simple logic this means the probability of a medium term high is 20% and just 7% for a low. In average (without any astro stuff) we could expect a 10% probability to see a MT high or low within a 10 day window.</p>
<p>Notes: The results for short term cycles are even less indicative.Â  It’s unlikely that a high within the next few days qualifies as medium term crest.</p>
