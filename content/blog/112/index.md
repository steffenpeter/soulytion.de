<p>The S&amp;P500 (chart of the index) wentÂ  down to the Mars ephemeris line and bounced back the very day Mars had its ingress to Capricorn. Additionally we had a small peak in the Bradley indicator. Reason enough to take this low seriously – even though this time we had no peak in PI Aspects.</p>
<p>This also happened on an important absolute Square-of-Nine prive level as shown in the following chart.</p>
