excerpt: 'I got the request to code a paintbar study that would paint the bars while a planet was in a certain sign. Say like when Mars is in Taurus?
And here it is: It highlights the bar for which a planet (you can set) is in a certain sign. The example chart highlights Mars in Taurus.'

<p>You can download the indicator from</p>

<p>This paintbar study works when the planetary indicator package is installed.</p>
<p>It is compiled for TradeStation 9. If ou use an earlier version I can convert it. Please let me know then.</p>
<p>And of course other great ideas for thing that could be done with the planetary indicator library are highly appreciated.</p>
