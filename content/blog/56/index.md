excerpt: 'The PlanetaryIndicators package allows to show periods of planetary retrograde movement either direct (using direct ephemeris) or as dedicated indicator. Retrograde means that a planet moves backward as seen from Earth. There are several theories that a planet turning retrograde (or back direct) has direct implication for markets.'
