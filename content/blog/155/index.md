I was pretty busy with my research position and just had little time for trading, research about trading, programming, or even writing about trading. But I am back – and soon new content will follow. My article about trading cycles should appear in the next few days. I also plan to go through my previous articles and see how my ideas and suggestions of the past worked out in the last few years.'

<p>This page has been inactive for a while. I am sorry. I was pretty busy with my <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~steffenp/">research position</a> and just had little time for trading, research about trading, programming, or even writing about trading. But I am back – and soon new content will follow. My article about trading cycles should appear in the next few days. I also plan to go through my previous articles and see how my ideas and suggestions of the past worked out in the last few years.</p>
<p>So stay tuned</p>
