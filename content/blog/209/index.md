<p>This is a follow-up to the <a href="/archives/159">cycle analysis posted a month ago</a>. There we saw that the 26 month and 7 year cycle have been the dominant cycles of the S&amp;P 500.</p>
<p>The chart below zooms in and shows the S&amp;P 500 for the last two years (white) and the 26 month cycle (blue), the 7 year cycle (orange), and the inverted standard Bradley (red).</p>
<p>The 7 year cycle, which worked almost perfectly in the last few year, shows a multi-month top right now.</p>
<p>The 26 month cycle is in the middle of its weakest phase of the cycle, until April.</p>
<p>The Bradley had it’s most significant extreme of the winter half year exactly at the time of the high of the S&amp;P.</p>
