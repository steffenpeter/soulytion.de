<p>The plot was made with the [PI] Bradley indicator which it is part of the <a href="/archives/category/planetaryindicators/">PlanetaryIndicators </a> package for Tradestation.</p>
<p>In case you do not have Tradestation to apply this indicator, you can order future and historic Bradley data formated as text, CSV or Excel. Send me an <a href="/impressum/">email</a>, or leave a comment and just let me know what you need.</p>
