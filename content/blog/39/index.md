<p>I became curious if Lunar and Sun Eclipses can be used as timing tool in the markets.<br/>
The results are not as clear as I hoped - but let’s study it a bit closer.</p>
<p>Here is the TradeStation indicator. It shows all Lunar and Sun Eclipses from 1901-2050 - as long as you have a data symbol in that range. To get future dates I recommend to read my previous post: <a href="/archives/35">HERE</a></p>
