<p>The approach was introduced by Donald Bradley in 1948� in his book Stock Market Prediction — The Planetary Barometer and How to Use It”.</p>
<p>The indicator draws the Bradley indication (Geocentric orignal formular) in your TradeStation chart (tested with TS2000i and TS8).</p>
<p>The screen shot shows the Bradley Siderograph for the years 2007 and 2008 as green line on top of the German DAX. Please remember the tool is not so much a price prediction but a timing instrument.</p>

<p>� <strong>How to install:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Download the <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/bradley080510.zip" title="Bradley Indicator for TradeStation 20080510">Bradley Indicator for TradeStation ZIP (1.3MB) here</a></li>
<li>Extract the DLL in your windows/system32 director (or in the Tradestation bin directory wherever it is)</li>
<li>Import the Bradley.ELS in your TradeStation</li>
</ul>
<p>� <strong>How to use:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Insert the indicator [SOULY] Bradley </li>
<li>The Bradley Siderograph is drawn in your chart window</li>
<li>Make sure you add some space to the right of your chart (you probably want to see future turns)</li>
<li>With the Expert Commentary tool you can click around and try to adjust the plot (still testing)</li>
<li>The input onexone sets the strech-factor of the indicator (for the DAX in the example I took onexone=6</li>
<li>Computable data range: 1994 to 2009 - so you have the chance for a lot of backtesting</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Edit Feb 2010: The </strong><a href="/archives/category/planetaryindicators/"><strong>Planetary Indicator Package</strong></a><strong>� contains indicators� to compute the Bradley without time limitations (for the last 100 years and the next 100 years if you want). So actually the ZIP here is obsolete.</strong></p>
